      <h1> While Murder Rates have exceeded records in the US, The Deadliest Region for Trans Murder is Improving</h1>

      <h2> By Sandra Lopez </h2>
      <h2> December 15, 2021 </h2>
<p> Between October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021, 375 trans and gender-diverse individuals were murdered worldwide.
  According to a report released by <a href= file:///Users/sandralopez/Desktop/TvT_TMM_TDoR2021_SimpleTable.pdf>Transrespect Versis Transphobia worldwide</a>, the region of Latin America accounts for 70% of these deaths. </p>

Observed in November, the Transgender day of Rememberance is a global day of commemoration for the lives lost to transphobic violence. While various events were scattered throughout NYC on the last week of November, community organizers from Make the Road NYC held a candlelight vigil at the Corona Plaza. Speakers took the stage to share their experiences of transphobic discrimation, many of whom were Immigrant trans women from countries in Latin America where they felt unsafe for being themselves.

<br>
27 year old Luna Guzman moved to the United States 7 months ago after various attempts to immigrate to the US. Luna decided to leave her country of origin because she faced discrimation, abuse, and human trafficking. "Now in New York, my life has changed a lot thanks to the support of various organizations. It's unfortunate however, to know that this year has become the year with highest registered number of trans people who have been murdered in the United States," says Guzman.

Another speaker, Geraldine Monroy of Mexico City, Mexico, shares a similar experience of abuse discrimination in her country, but her fears in the United States remain. "It's unfortunate that just as we feared for our lives in our countries of origin, we continue to fear for our lives in this country," says Guzman.
</br>

<br>
Both of these women come from a region that has been considered the deadliest for the trans community. 
</br>

<br>
 While the national death rate in the United States has <a href= https://transrespect.org/en/tmm-update-tdor-2021/> reached an all time high</a>, murder rates across the deadliest region for trans communities are seeing a decline in the number of homicides against transgender and gender diverse individuals. Below, three maps chart the progressive decline in Murders against trans persons region-wide.
